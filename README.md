A toolkit to help with ingame script (programmable block) development for Keen Software House's space sandbox Space Engineers. It helps you create a ready-to-code project for writing ingame scripts, and provides an analyzer which warns you if you're trying to use something that is not allowed in Space Engineers.

### General features
* Helps you create a fully connected script project in Visual Studio, with all references in place
* Requires that you have the game installed, but does _not_ require you to have it running
* Class templates for normal utility classes and extension classes
* Tells you if you're using code that's not allowed in Space Engineers (whitelist checker)
* Deploys multiple classes into a single PB script, which then is placed in the local Workshop space for easy access in-game - no copy/paste needed
* Supports optional code minifying: Fit more code within the limits of the programmable block
* Allows real reusable code libraries through the use of Visual Studio's Shared Project
* Out-of-game script blueprint manager allows you to rename and delete script blueprints without starting the game
